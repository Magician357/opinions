A line unspoken.
A song without a melody.
A beat without a rhythm.
A dance without a step.
/
Feel the world around you
Let your cries be heard aloud
/
A prayer without words.
A vow without a voice.
A promise without a touch.
/
And as the world slowly fades away
I'll be here waiting for you
/
I cant stand to feel
Yet I cannot feel a thing
But the love I have for you
Will always remain
/
I've walked past these hallways,
Searched every door.
Yet I can't find my way,
To the one I adore.
/
Song without a melody
plays for me, softly.
Dancing in the rain,
I pray for thee.
/
And as the world slowly fades away
I'll be here waiting for you
/
So let all your feelings free
Open up your head
Let your thoughts roam wild in the trees
And your body just lies in the bed
/
Sleep tight, yet night will never come
For dawn is but a step away
And in the end, we'll all be one
Once again someday 
/
And as the world slowly fades away
I'll be here waiting for you
/
At the edge of the earth
People pray to me
And as they all kneel
They put their fate in my hands
/
With a shattered heart
And a tear in my eye
I vow to never let them down
/
And as the world slowly fades away
I'll be here waiting for you

Your face, your eyes, your smile,
Same as everyone before you,
Naming parts they claim for themselves,
Nowhere near unique.

They say we are all different,
Yet all we see is what’s the same.
Same eyes, same color, same voice.
Never what was lost.

Every action, noise, or feeling
Sound or silence, restless or calm,
They judge and compare, never resting,
Always they critique 

Never do they wonder, what’s new?
What’s better than before?
Still mixed their perspectives of us,
Oblivious to the cost.
